// Question 20: Think of something you could store in an array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.

let schoolteachers: string[]= ["Sir Muzammil", "Sir Ahtesham", "Sir Basit", "Sir Masood"]
schoolteachers.forEach(schoolteacher =>{
    console.log(`Thanks ${schoolteacher}, for your tireless efforts`)
})
